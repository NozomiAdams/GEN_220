Write a program called print_triples.py. Print out all the numbers from 0 to 100 and print * next to the numbers which are 
perfectly divisible by 3. 

Do this by making a loop which counts up from 0...100
Check the number to see if it is divisible perfectly by 3 (no remainder)
Print a * next to the number if that is the case

>>> for i in range(0,101):
...     if i % 3 == 0:
...             print(i,'*')
...     else:
...             print(i)
...

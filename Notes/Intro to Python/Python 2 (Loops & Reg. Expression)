More Python Loops, Arrays, & Functions
#useful to walk through your data and perform logic
#testing operators

a < b - test if something is less than
a > b - test if something is greater than
a >=b - test if something is greater than or equal
a > b and b > b - combine logic using AND
a > b or b > c - combine using OR
not(a < b) - negate the result with NOT

LOGIC SOME MORE
>>> a=1
>>> b=2
>>> if a !=b:
...     print("a not b")
... else:
...     print("a==b")
... 
a not b
>>> if not (a !=b):
...     print("a not b")
... else:
...     print("a==b")
... 
a==b

FOR LOOPS
#reminder of how to use for to iterate through items in a list or a string

 dna="AAGATCAGGAC"
>>> for c in dna:
...     print("DNA base is" + c)
... 
DNA base isA
DNA base isA
DNA base isG
DNA base isA
DNA base isT
DNA base isC
DNA base isA
DNA base isG
DNA base isG
DNA base isA
DNA base isC

>>> for c in range(len(dna)):
...     print("DNA base is" + dna[c])
... 
DNA base isA
DNA base isA
DNA base isG
DNA base isA
DNA base isT
DNA base isC
DNA base isA
DNA base isG
DNA base isG
DNA base isA
DNA base isC

>>> for n in lst:
...     print("items is", n)
... 
items is 70
items is 78
items is 12

LOOPS WITH WHILE
#another way to loop is to use the while operator
>>> i=0
>>> while i < 10:
...     print("i is", i)
... 
i is 0
i is 0
i is 0
i is 0
i is 0
i is 0
i is 0
i is 0
i is 0
i is 0

FUNCTIONS
#function info: def to define the function, can use return to indicate the return from the routine

# code to calculate the average
def average(lst):
"""This is the average function
"""
    sum = 0;
    for n in lst:
       sum += n
    return sum / len(lst)
print average([1,2,3,4,5,100])

REGULAR EXPRESSIONS AND MATCHING
>>> import re
>>> m = re.search('(dog)','dogwood');
>>> if m:
...     print("contains dog")
...     print(m.group(0))
... 
contains dog
dog

>>> m = re.search('(d[aoe]g)','dogwood');
>>> if m:
...     print(m.group(0))
... 
dog

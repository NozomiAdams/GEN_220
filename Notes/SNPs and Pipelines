Bioinformatics 4 - Comparative genomics, Finding Orthologs and Paralogues
Are same genes in 2 or 3 different species
repeats and transposable elements 
if genes are there, ask where are the genes in the genome and are the genes in the same place?
dot plot: 2 genomes or chromosomes x scale species A and Y axis is species B
This 12 base sequence, where is the sequence like this in the other species
Does that sequence exist in the chromosome of species B if there is you put a dot there
everyone of 12 base pair overlapping is unique. Species b is identical to species a
take the whole chromosome and flip it over
need assembly of the genome
gene content could be the same but differences in the organization 

Repeat content:
RepeatMasker it is a library of known sequneces that are repetetive of transposable elements. it is a blast of TEs
not a model system: build a library of TEs genome against itself and identifies regions with high copy numbers
RepeatModler script to run with SBATCH
each sequence can be a distinct repetitive element
developing a library of known repeats and then take the library of repeats. 
Tells you where there are repeats search against known repeats at the protein level
ID by similarity RepeatMaster breaks down the number of repeats that you found
could use all as the search to ID if genome contains any of the repeat elements
summary table about the particular genome
genome annotation you want to mask out the repeats. could not be a protein coding gene, but transposons
Orthologs and Paralogs
ID genes that are shared between different species 
if you want to know the alpha copies from all the other species orthologs: genes identical by descent
paralogs: duplicates within a species 
Are there genes specific to something; we know how to use blast to find things that are similar
phylogenetic trees start with genome and classify what orthologous groups thy fit into
e-value: what is what is likelood of finding this hit by chance
gene loss/duplication/ events using NOTONG
bidirectional or recipricol blast
write code to do this

single linkage: a link between cluster A and B they automatically go into the same cluster
you want to know the things that are multi-copied
single linkage is a statistical approach: linkage between 2 things: e-value cutoff for proteins the 2 things are linked
with OTUs is it transitive? 
single linkage can be useful for certain approaches
Issues
cases of loss: how do you identify the things that are found across multiple species 
take best recipricols and linke they together with single linkage
OrthoMCL - requires SQL database
Orthogogue - don't need to have a database
what sequence came from what species; when running analysis with all pairwise analyses
all contained in 1 file, we need a way to figure out what species each came from
look up table or change name of sequences so that they start with a prefix
rename sequence file so that it has a prefix for that species and gene name, accession name
you want to have some way to have a prefix
concatente all of them into one protein file and index the database and search the databae against itself
this generates a big blast table and then run tool called orthogogue and give it an input file
-e 6 is the evalue power this generates an input file to a program called mcl, which does aspects of clustering
imagine all proteins from all species laid down in a 2D graph: you have a single copy orthology that are similar
distance are small if they are really similar. single copy protein all woul be next to eachother 
how consistent is that group?
